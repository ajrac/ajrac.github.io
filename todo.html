    <h1>To Do List</h1>
    <a href="/index.html">Back Home</a>
    <p>-Want to learn a lot more about css/styling to make this website look a lot better. Currently the styling isn't terrible but still very primative.</p>
    <p>-Want to start messing around with Discord API and maybe make a bot. Typescript/JS are very common with discord bots, good opportunity to learn those. </p>
    <p>-Want to make something interactive on a webpage on this website, not too sure where to start or what I want to do, will do more reading to get into it.</p>
