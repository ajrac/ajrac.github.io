    <p>Getting Started with GitHub Pages - Youtube video </p>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyFcl_Fba-k">link</a>
    <p>This video basically got me started in making my portfolio website. The initial purpose for me seeking this video was the semantics of setting up the pages site through 
        Github, but I ended up taking a lot away from the video such as messing with the <a href="https://github.com/ajrac/ajrac.github.io/blob/main/style.css">styling</a> of my site, how branching works on GitHub as well as basics of css/html given that I've never touched
    those languages before in the past. </p>
