      <p>Getting Started with GitHub Pages - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyFcl_Fba-k">Youtube video</a>  </p>
      <p>This video basically got me started in making my portfolio website. The initial purpose for me seeking this video was the semantics of setting up the pages site through 
          Github, but I ended up taking a lot away from the video such as messing with the <a href="https://github.com/ajrac/ajrac.github.io/blob/main/style.css">styling</a> of my site, how branching works on GitHub as well as basics of css/html given that I've never touched
      those languages before in the past. Overall, this video helped me out a lot in starting out on my portfolio and getting my feet wet in web dev.</p>
      <p>Learn Git Branching - <a href="https://learngitbranching.js.org/">Tutorial/activity</a></p>
      <p>This website was quite useful shake off some of the rust I had with Git. I have used Git in the past, but it has been quite a while since I've used it truthfully, so 
          this resource that Dr. Bart left in the discord helped me out quite a bit in refamiliarizing myself with Git version controlling again. I then continued on with the website activity,
          as it also included some advanced exercises towards the end. I will admit the advanced topics were challenging, but I learned about some new aspects of Git, such as Git cherry picking.
          With the help of some research outside of the website to help me out, I feel as if I learned a lot about git after using this website.

      <p>Typescript Playground - <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/play#show-examples">Tutorial/activity</a></p>
      <p>This is one of the activities that was shared on the portfolio assignment page on Canvas. I played around with some of the activities on this page, and got my feet wet 
          with typescript. I particularly thought the "any" and "unknown" primative types were interesting. I never expected such flexibiltiy with a programming language before,
          basically allowing to account for situations in which one does not know the type, for example. I understood generally how types and interfaces worked from my work with other languages,
          but the sections that this site had on them worked as a good refresher and helped me see how they work specifically within typescript. The typescript playground did a good job of introducing 
          me to the language and refreshing some concepts for me.

      <p>Maggie Slideshow - <a href ="/dog.html">Web Page</a></p>
      <p>I made a simple slideshow of my dog, Maggie, using javascript with help from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAAD3mmQGRQ">this tutorial.</a> Not a very involved webpage
          but its getting me more familiar with javascript both semantically and mechanically. I also got to apply some more css/html to this web page with styling. The source images are actually
          quite a high resolution, so I had to learn to use max-width and max-height properties in CSS to make them viewable. I still think i learned
          quite a bit in terms of how javascript applies to web pages, and how it works with html and such.</p>
      <p>How to Show and Hide Content With an HTML Accordion - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1l0ByI7Dn4">Youtube Video</a></p>
      <p>This video was a good resource I used to make my Todo and Changelog sections look a bit cleaner. The video also goes over some css tips which I used elsewhere on my site, such as padding, alignment, and margins. 
         Overall This is probably a small addition, but I feel inclined to include it as I learned something new and useful from it.
      <p>CSS Crash Course - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfoY53QXEnI">Youtube Video</a></p>
      <p>This video did a great job on teaching me css. Before I watched this I was kinda lost with css styling, but I learned a lot from this and got to apply that knowledge into my site.
         On top of learning a lot about html from this video, I learned a lot about classes, borders/margins, styles, images, and applied all of that into my site. I think that my site looks much
         better than it did in the previous week after applying what I learned in this video, and I think that I have a pretty solid grasp on how HTML works now, and how it connects to CSS.

      <p>The Quiz - <a href="/quiz.html">Web Page</a></p>
      <p>I made a simple Javascript quiz using alerts in the browser. I learned how to do so from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQGTb112N_c">this</a>youtube video. 
         The resource was helpful for learning some more about the basics of js. I am aware it is quite primative, but I plan on making it more fleshed out in the future for sure, maybe I'll re-do it with typescript or react.
         One problem I ran into was that I couldn't get the escape characters for tabs to work properly, but I had a very ugly workaround of manually entering blankspaces into the prompts. 
         I'm not sure if I did the tab escape characters wrong or what but hopefully I can figure out how to fix that as well in the future. Fun and simple little project.</p>
