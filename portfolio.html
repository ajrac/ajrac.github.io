    <h1>My Portfolio</h1>

    <p>Getting Started with GitHub Pages - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyFcl_Fba-k">Youtube video</a>  </p>
    <p>This video basically got me started in making my portfolio website. The initial purpose for me seeking this video was the semantics of setting up the pages site through 
        Github, but I ended up taking a lot away from the video such as messing with the <a href="https://github.com/ajrac/ajrac.github.io/blob/main/style.css">styling</a> of my site, how branching works on GitHub as well as basics of css/html given that I've never touched
    those languages before in the past. Overall, this video helped me out a lot in starting out on my portfolio and getting my feet wet in web dev.</p>
    <p>Learn Git Branching - <a href="https://learngitbranching.js.org/">Tutorial/activity</a></p>
    <p>This website was quite useful shake off some of the rust I had with Git. I have used Git in the past, but it has been quite a while since I've used it truthfully, so 
        this resource that Dr. Bart left in the discord helped me out quite a bit in refamiliarizing myself with Git version controlling again. I then continued on with the website activity,
        as it also included some advanced exercises towards the end. I will admit the advanced topics were challenging, but I learned about some new aspects of Git, such as Git cherry picking.
         With the help of some research outside of the website to help me out, I feel as if I learned a lot about git after using this website.

    <p>Typescript Playground - <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/play#show-examples">Tutorial/activity</a></p>
    <p>This is one of the activities that was shared on the portfolio assignment page on Canvas. I played around with some of the activities on this page, and got my feet wet 
        with typescript. I particularly thought the "any" and "unknown" primative types were interesting. I never expected such flexibiltiy with a programming language before,
        basically allowing to account for situations in which one does not know the type, for example. I understood generally how types and interfaces worked from my work with other languages,
        but the sections that this site had on them worked as a good refresher and helped me see how they work specifically within typescript. The typescript playground did a good job of introducing 
        me to the language and refreshing some concepts for me.
